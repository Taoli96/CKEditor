 * the {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor editor} instance.
 *
 * Instances of registered commands can be retrieved from {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#commands}.
 * The easiest way to execute a command is through {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#execute}.
 *
 * By default commands are disabled when the editor is in {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#isReadOnly read-only} mode.
